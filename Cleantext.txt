Title 
 Free Nazanin Ratcliffe

Text 
My wife Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 37 year old charity worker, was on holiday visiting her family in Iran. She was at the airport returning to the UK on the 3rd April when she was detained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. She has been transferred to an unknown location in Kerman Province, 1,000 kilometres south of Tehran, and is being held in solitary confinement.
Gabriella Ratcliffe our 22 month old daughter (who has British citizenship only) has had her British passport confiscated, and is stranded in Iran with her grandparents.
Nazanin has not been allowed to access a lawyer or her daughter. She has not been able to call out of the country to speak to me, her British husband, and the Red Cross have not been able to make contact.
There have been no charges. Nazanin has informed her family that she has been required to sign a confession under duress, its content unknown. Her family have been informed that the investigation relates to an issue of ‘national security’.
It is hard to understand how a young mother and her small child on holiday could be considered an issue of national security. She has been to Iran to visit her family regularly since making Britain her home.
Nazanin currently works as a project manager for the Thomson-Reuters Foundation; which delivers charitable projects around the world. It does not work in Iran.
Nazanin has now been in solitary confinement for over 30 days.
Please help bring my wife and daughter home by signing my petition calling on our Prime Minister Theresa May to use her power and intervene.

 Stop using labels as an excuse! Teach disabled children to read and write #TeachUsToo

Text 
My name is Jonathan Bryan and I am 11 years old. Until the age of 9 I was unable to communicate, as I am in a wheelchair with Cerebral Palsy and my voice does not work. 
Learning to spell, using only my eyes, has totally transformed my life, but it is only possible because my mother taught me to read and write. 
What brings me incredible sorrow is watching my non-verbal friends in wheelchairs miss out on the fullness of life because no-one believes that they are worth teaching literacy to, and waiting locked in for someone to give them a chance to have a voice.
In my experience, non-verbal children like me can’t be described as having Profound and Multiple Learning Difficulties (PMLD) when they have never been taught. At the age of 4, I entered the special education system yoked with the label PMLD despite no-one having taught me; or having found a way for me to communicate.
I believe children like me should be reclassified as having Profound and Multiple Access to Learning Difficulties. 
Special needs teachers must believe in the potential of their pupils, take the time to find out how the different children will access literacy, and then teach them. 
Disabled children with communication issues are not being taught in special schools.  They are being babysat!
If literacy was taught to children in special schools more children would be unlocked like me. 
My dream is that every non-verbal child is taught to read and write. 
Underestimating special needs children is robbing them of their right to education and communication.  Until this is seen as the abuse it is, nothing will change. 
Reforming the special needs curriculum must be a priority.

Title 
 Introduce ‘Helen’s Law': where hiding a body, preventing a burial and obstructing a coroner become criminal offences - with ‘whole life’ tariffs

Text 
To lose a loved one is devastating. To lose a loved one to murder is horrific. To be denied their funeral causes unimaginable suffering. I have endured this nightmare for almost 28 years. Ian Simms is serving a life sentence (on overwhelming forensic evidence) for the murder of my daughter Helen McCourt, aged 22, on 9 February 1988, in Billinge, Lancs. For almost three decades Simms has refused to reveal the whereabouts of Helen’s body – denying us the chance to grant her the dignity of a funeral and resting place.The case made legal history as only the third ever UK murder trial without a body. Sadly, as killers go to ever-desperate lengths to hide evidence and evade justice such cases have become more common. Without stiffer penalties they will continue to rise. In January 2016 a Parole Board will decide on Simms’ application for freedom. As it currently stands, the English legal system does not require a convicted murderer (at the end of their determined tariff) to admit guilt or reveal the location of a victim’s remains before being released. If parole is granted, my hopes of finding my daughter may never be realised. No other family should live this ordeal.I, hereby, petition the Prime Minister Theresa May and Home Secretary Sajid Javid to acknowledge the pain and distress caused to the families of missing murder victims by:

Denying parole to murderers for as long as they refuse to disclose the whereabouts of their victim’s remains
Passing a full life tariff (denying parole or release) until the murderer discloses the location (and enables the recovery) of their victim’s remains
Automatically applying the following rarely-used common law offences in murder trials without a body*; preventing the burial of a corpse and conspiracy to prevent the burial of a corpse, disposing of a corpse, obstructing a coroner (*as in the case of R v Hunter, 1974 (from Archbold, Criminal Pleading Evidence and Practice 2015)

Denying a funeral is, surely, an infringement of basic human rights. Please support me.

 Ailing 92 year old Facing Forced Removal From UK

Text 
Myrtle Cothill is a frail 92-year-old South African lady. She is at risk of being removed by the Home Office to a country where she has nobody to look after her and nowhere to stay. Myrtle has been living with Mary Wills, her British 66-year-old daughter who is also a qualified carer, since her arrival in the UK in February 2014. I am Myrtle's barrister and I have launched this petition on behalf of her to call on the Home Office to grant Mrytle leave to remain in the UK.
Suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and macular degeneration causing sight loss, Myrtle cannot walk unaided, has a chronic cough, poor vision, is hard of hearing and is experiencing increasing confusion. She is unable to care or cook for herself and relies on her daughter Mary for emotional and physical support: Mary helps her mother with her personal care, housework, cooking and shopping.
Mary and her 61year old British husband David, cannot move to South Africa to look after her mother there as they have no right to live in South Africa. David is also ill and unable to travel, suffering from Parkinson’s disease and COPD which severely affects his mobility and breathing. Both David’s and Myrtle’s medical conditions are degenerative and likely to deteriorate further in the future.   
Like any good daughter and wife, Mary deeply loves her husband and her mother and just wants to take care of them. However, the Home Office has refused Myrtle leave to remain in the UK and is expecting the 92-year-old to return to South Africa on her own. This would rip the family apart and leave them broken-hearted. The Courts have felt unable to overturn the Home Office decision, relying the stringent nature of the current Immigration Rules on adult dependent relatives (see below for detail).
“My mother just cannot live on her own,” says Mary, “and emotionally, to her as well as for myself, it would really tear strips out of our heart and probably would kill my mother (and maybe myself as well).”
The present immigration rule on adult dependant relatives introduced in 2012[1] makes it almost impossible for British citizens to bring their elderly parents to live with them in the UK in their declining years.
Those like Mary who want to help and do the right thing have to deal with the wedge this immigration rule drives between them. It breaks up families like Myrtle’s, Mary’s and David’s, leads to unspeakable heartache and undermines the very essence of family values.
We call on the Home Office and the Government to:
1)      Grant Myrtle Cothill leave to remain in the UK to live out what days she has left under the care of her daughter;
2)      Reverse the amendment of the immigration rule on adult dependant relatives which came into force in July 2012 radically changing the previous rule (which was in place for over 40yrs) which allowed British nationals and other settled persons (i.e. persons with indefinite leave to remain) to be joined by their parents/grandparents aged over 65yrs if they could be accommodated and financially supported by their children/grandchildren without reliance on the public purse. 
3)      Reinstate the previous immigration rule on family reunion to enable others like Myrtle to be granted leave to remain in the UK.
Footnote [1] The new immigration rule only allows British citizens, and other (non-EU) settled persons, to be joined by relatives where the long-term care they require is either not available or not affordable in their country of residence, but privately payable by them in the UK – this means that the only family members who will be allowed to join their families in the UK will be those who live in countries where medical care is more expensive than in the UK or entirely non-existent.

Title 
 Lower the age for bowel cancer screening in England to 50

Text 
Exactly a year ago today, my family was dealt an earth shattering blow when my mum was diagnosed with bowel cancer. She was 55 at the time, and we were told soon after, that the cancer was terminal.
She started chemotherapy immediately after diagnosis, but it was unfortunately too little, too late, and she passed away in March this year, a week after her 56th birthday.
Screening for bowel cancer is available on the NHS, but only from the age of 60. However, in Scotland they start screening from the age of 50. Finding this out was quite a bitter blow. If we lived in Scotland my mum would have already been screened three times before she was finally diagnosed, increasing her chance of being diagnosed earlier and increasing her chance of survival.
Screening isn’t foolproof, but Bowel Cancer is the second biggest cancer killer in the UK and if caught in its earliest stages it’s curable. Cancer research published earlier this year found that if bowel cancer is caught in its earliest stages, there is a 97% chance of surviving 5 years. But if the cancer is caught in its later stages there is a 7% chance of survival. From figures I have found through research, I've estimated that up to 6000 people a year are being diagnosed with bowel cancer in their 50's. Considering they have had no screening available to them at all, I wonder how many of those like my mum are being diagnosed too late.
My Mum was the kind of person who would do anything for anyone. She was utterly selfless, loving and wonderful. Unfortunately nothing can change what has happened to my family, and we are having to live with our grief and heartbreak. But if by fighting for this change, even one family are spared this kind of loss then I think it's worth it.

Title 
 Open civil partnerships to all

Text 
We’re Rebecca and Charles, and we want to celebrate our relationship and provide protection for our family by having a civil partnership. However, until recently, we could not do so because the Civil Partnership Act 2004 states: ‘Two people are not eligible to register as civil partners of each other if … they are not of the same sex.’
With your support, we mounted a successful legal challenge. In June 2018, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the current situation is discriminatory, cannot be justified, and is therefore unlawful. 
Soon after, in October 2018, Prime Minister Theresa May publicly announced her Government's commitment to extend civil partnerships to all. 
In March 2019, Tim Loughton MP’s private members’ bill received royal assent and became the Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths (Registration etc) Act.
Now, civil partnerships will be available to opposite-sex couples from 31st December 2019.
Key points are:

Notice can be given for different sex civil partnerships from 2nd December 2019
Civil partnerships can take place 28 days after – so from 31st December 2019
In exceptional cases, such as terminal illness, notice period can be waived. Seek advice from your local register office or contact the General Register Office
Couples who have formed a civil partnership or equivalent outside the UK will automatically have their relationship recognised from 2nd December
The government will decide by mid-2020 whether to grant the right to convert a marriage to a civil partnership (or vice versa) and if so for how long
Northern Ireland will permit mixed-sex civil partnerships from 13th January 2020
Scotland is currently consulting on its own legislation with a view to extending CPs

Can you believe the change we’ve all made together?!
Our own civil partnership plans will be simple and straightforward, just like we always wanted. On New Years Eve, we’ll be heading back to Chelsea Register office with our children to form our civil partnership in front of two witnesses - for the statutory minimum fee of £46, plus £22 for two certificates. That'll give us the legal status and recognition, rights and protections, and official partnership of equals that we’ve sought all along. It’s been a tough journey at times, so we plan to unwind in the company of close friends and family on New Years Eve to celebrate love and legal reform!
But please don’t let our plans influence what you do. In fact, don’t let anyone tell you what you should do. Just do what is right for you. Civil partnerships are a blank slate, there’s no social script. Take the opportunity to do whatever you want. 
From the bottom of our hearts, we thank you for all your support. We literally could not have gotten this far without you. 
Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan

Title 
 Create a law to protect models from being pressured to lose weight!

Text 
I’m a 27 year old model, a clothes size 8. The girl in the picture is me. When I walked into one of the UK’s biggest model agencies last year they told me I ticked all the boxes except one -- I needed to lose weight. So I did. Four months later I lost nearly a stone, 2 inches off my hips. When I returned to the same agency they told me to lose more weight, they wanted me "down to the bone".When I look in the mirror I see someone that is healthy and comfortable in their skin. That’s because I had the guts to carve out my own path and refuse to let people pressure me into losing more and more weight. But with London Fashion Week the reminders are everywhere that we need a law to protect young girls, and boys, who are put under pressure to be dangerously thin.Modelling can be a very lonely place, especially for girls working internationally who are away from the usual support network of friends and family. When models travel overseas they are often put into shared accommodation with other models, and being surrounded by girls who are all striving to stay thin can perpetuate bad eating habits and encourage eating disorders. I’ve been on shoots for up to 10 hours where no food is provided -- the underlying message is always that you shouldn’t eat. The agencies managing and recruiting models have a responsibility to the wellbeing of girls on the catwalk at fashion week, and in the industry as a whole.France became the latest country to vote to criminalise the use of models who are dangerously thin. Those breaking the law face fines and up to six months in jail. And there is growing momentum for change in the UK - but we are still far from achieving a healthy standard for all models. The time is now for us all to come together.
Please sign my petition to create a law to protect vulnerable young girls and boys in the industry.*Note: the fur in the image is fake fur!

Title 
 Provide tests for Group B Strep to prevent any more avoidable deaths of newborn babies

Text 
My partner Scott and I should have been sharing our son Edward Gili’s first birthday in May 2015. But instead of having that exciting first year to celebrate and many more to look forward to, we had just 9 precious days to spend with our beautiful son.
Edward was cruelly taken from us as a result of contracting group B Strep infection at birth. On average, two babies a day in the UK develops group B Strep infection. One baby a week dies from group B Strep infection. One baby a week who survives the infection is left with long-term disabilities - physical, mental or both. It is the UK’s most common cause of severe bacterial infection in newborn babies, and of meningitis in babies under 3 months.
Group B Strep is a normal bacterium carried by around 1/4 women, without symptoms and usually unknowingly. It can be passed from mother to baby around birth with potentially devastating consequences for the baby. But these consequences are usually preventable and that’s why I’ve started this petition with the charity Group B Strep Support.
Unlike many other developed countries including Germany and Spain, the UK does not routinely offer tests to pregnant women specifically to check for Group B Strep carriage during late pregnancy. If doctors know a mum is carrying GBS, they can administer simple antibiotics during labour to prevent the infection - over 80% of these infections could be prevented. However the GBS-specific ECM (enriched culture medium) test is rarely available through the NHS.
Since 2003, the UK has used ‘risk factors’ to guess which pregnant women might be at risk. Risk factors are poor at predicting which babies will develop the infection -- the number of babies infected is growing, we need to stop guessing and start testing. The ECM test costs the NHS £11 each and the antibiotics used in labour (usually penicillin) cost the NHS pennies.
Had we had ECM tests in place, Edward Gili could be here today for us to see his first steps and hear his first words. We can’t afford to lose any more lives, we can’t afford not to do this.

Title 
 Introduce compulsory age-appropriate retesting every 3 years once a driver turns 70

Text 
On 10 November 2012, just after 8pm, I left my friends' house in northwest London, a happily married 33-year-old father. It was then that I heard my wife, Desreen, speak her final words: ‘I’m so proud of him,’ she said of our two-year-old son, Jackson. Seconds later a car mounted the pavement and struck Desreen. It was a pensioner who’d mistaken the accelerator for the brake, and was going 54 miles per hour in a 20 zone. In that moment I became a widower.
The judge who sentenced the 85-year-old driver who killed my wife said; ‘An elderly driver who knows, or should acknowledge, that he or she is losing his or her faculties is no less a danger than a drunken driver who knows the same.’
I agree, that's why I've started this petition calling for people over 70 to undergo compulsory retesting to keep their driving licence.
Right now when drivers turn 70 they can renew their licence every three years by filling in a self assessment form. No one assesses an older person’s driving skills or reactions, no one checks their eyesight or hearing, no one sees if their reactions are still sharp enough to stop in an emergency.
Despite this, some officials are recommending that in order to save costs, people shouldn't have to renew their licence until they are 80.
I know the human cost of unfit drivers on the road and I never want anyone to go through a tragedy like the one that has decimated my family.
So I am asking you to sign and support my petition for the Secretary of State for Transport to introduce compulsory age-appropriate retesting every three years once a driver turns 70.
In the longer term, the Government should be making plans so they can support the mobility of elderly people, whose response rates are proven to diminish with age, not simply by keeping car keys in their hands, but through improved public transport, infrastructure and inclusion. Please help me with this.
Thank you,
Ben

Title 
 Justice for Chunky - stop people who abuse animals from owning ever again

Text 
This petition is for Chunky the Chihuahua who was attacked for hours in what the RSPCA called one of the most disturbing cases of animal abuse they had ever seen. Chunky was, over a period of hours, beaten and drugged, his neck was broken, he was set on fire and finally he was dumped and left for dead. Despite serious injury, and against all odds, Chunky lived. The people who committed this abuse were only banned from keeping animals for five years. As an animal lover, who once owned a dog just like Chunky, I found this story highly upsetting. What shocked me is that these abusers and others like them will be able to own an animal again one day. There’s nothing to prevent them doing this again. I'm asking that anyone who abuses animals, regardless of their age, be placed on an Animal Cruelty Register which would follow them for life. In some states in the US they already have animal abuse registries. If this had happened in New York these abusers would have to sign onto an animal abuse list that would prevent them from ownership of animals. The UK need to introduce a similar law. A five year ban is not sufficient-- it is hard to implement in practice and why do we assume abusers attitudes will have changed after a few years? Our legal system should have an animal abuse list so that we are aware of people who have mistreated animals.  Please sign this petition for an animal abuse register. Let's get justice for dogs like Chunky.
